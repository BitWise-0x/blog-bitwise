Full-stack engineer and founder of BitWiseSolutions. Primary areas of focus include backend development, infrastructure automation, artificial intelligence, and the blockchain.

Most of my work centers around backend development, orchestration and deployment patterns, automation, and clustering.

That extends into Ai through use-case explorations of both frontier and self-hosted large language models, programmatic generative workflows, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and conversational interfaces that go beyond basic text. More recently, voice Ai and emotion-aware interaction.

In the crypto space, I explore the mechanics behind DeFi protocols and trustless exchanges, investment automation, and signal-driven strategies.

With this blog, I explore various topics and design philosophies behind these areas, covering architectural decisions, implementation examples, and problems encountered along the way.
