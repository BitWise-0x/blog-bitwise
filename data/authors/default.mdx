Full-stack engineer and founder of BitWiseSolutions, focused on backend development, orchestration/deployment patterns, artificial intelligence, and blockchain.

I work extensively with both frontier and self-hosted (edge) AI large language models: from programmatic generative workflows and business logic, to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), to conversational interfaces that push beyond basic text. More recently, speech-to-speech and emotion-aware AI interaction.

I also dig into the mechanics behind DeFi protocols and trustless exchanges, investment automation, and signal-driven strategies.

This blog captures the topics and design philosophies behind all of it: architectural decisions, implementation details, and the inevitable hurdles along the way.
