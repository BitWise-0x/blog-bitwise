Full-stack engineer and founder of BitWiseSolutions. Primary areas of focus include backend development, orchestration/deployment patterns, artificial intelligence, and the blockchain.

I deep-dive a wide variety of use-cases with both frontier and self-hosted (edge) Ai large language models, including programmatic generative workflows and business logic, retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and conversational interfaces that go beyond basic text. More recently, Speech-to-Speech, emotion-aware Ai interaction.

I also explore the mechanics behind DeFi protocols and trustless exchanges, investment automation, and signal-driven strategies.

With this blog, I explore topics and design philosophies behind these areas, covering architectural decisions, implementation examples, and the inevitable hurdles encountered along the way.
